# This script is used to debug the network switch client implementation
# To run this locally, you need to have virtual environment with the dependencies installed.
# You can create a virtual environment with the following command:
# python3 -m venv venv
# source venv/bin/activate
# pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Then you can run the script with the following command:
# python3 debug.py
